# Toy CI automation tool (Formerly Merel)

The goal of this project was to get a better understand of how tools like GitHub Actions and Jenkins are designed.

I had a decent chunk working before I eventually gave up. I might come back to this in the future.

## Motivation

I was heavily motivated after reading [500 lines or less](https://aosabook.org/en/#500lines). There's a section about CI/CD automation. After reading this, I felt like I understood enough to give it a go. 

I encourage everyone to at least try one of their AOSA editions. I can guarantee you'll learn something.
